# hello-world
My time honored tradition repository, also where I store ideas, resources and awesome things. 

Hello there earthlings! I am a girl who dreams of creating simple code that makes it eaiser for humans to be good to their earth and fellow animals. Tech as a symbiotic element, creating harmony. I also want transporters to be a real thing and to sail to French Polynesia...
